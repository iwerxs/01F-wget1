I have to build a `WGET` application, the objective is to recreate some functionalities of wget using a compiled language, like C, Rust, Go
These functionalities will consist in:
The normal usage of wget: downloading a file given an URL, example: wget https://some_url.ogr/file.zip
- Downloading a single file and saving it under a different name
- Downloading and saving the file in a specific directory
- Set the download speed, limiting the rate speed of a download
- Downloading a file in background
- Downloading multiple files at the same time, by reading a file containing multiple download links asynchronously
- Main feature will be to download an entire website
The application:
- must have as arguments the link from where you want to download the file
- should be able to give feedback, displaying the:
Time that the program started: it must have the following format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
Status of the request. For the program to proceed to the download, it must present a response to the request as status OK (200 OK) if not, it should say which status it got and finish the operation with an error warning
Size of the content downloaded: the content length can be presented as raw (bytes) and rounded to Mb or Gb depending on the size of the file downloaded
Name and path of the file that is about to be saved
A progress bar, having the following:
A amount of KiB or MiB (depending on the download size) that was downloaded
A percentage of how much was downloaded
Time that remains to finish the download
Time that the download finished respecting the previous format
